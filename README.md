# Project_BattleCity

**GUIDELINES**

**Programming**

- Use https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/Framework/QuickReference/index.html to learn how UE4 is structured.
- Class Actor, this is the base class of almost ALL classes in UE4 !!important!! (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/index.html)
- Class GameMode/GameState (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/Framework/GameMode/index.html)
- Class Pawn (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/Framework/Pawn/index.html)
- Class Controller (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/Framework/Controller/index.html)
- For our first game we should focus on Blueprint scripting (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Blueprints/index.html)
- We are creating a 2D game.. so Paper2D is very important (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Paper2D/index.html)

**Graphics**
- Sprite size: 16x16 pixels
- Collision size: 8x8 pixels
- Character size: 32x32 pixels
- Tilemap size: 26x26 sprites

- Movable Sprites need to work for 4 directions(North, East, South, West)
- Use TexturePacker (https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/) to create Spritesheets for UE4 (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Paper2D/Importing/index.html)
- FÃ¼r Animationen (https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Paper2D/Flipbooks/index.html)

**Sounds**
- Sample Rate: 44100 Hz / 22050 Hz
- Format: .WAV
- Bit Rate: 16
- Speaker Channels: Mono, Stereo, 2.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1
